### Live Site = [Pal-lette](https://pal-lette.herokuapp.com/)

### Vegetarian/Vegan Recipe Helper 

A website designed to provide user's with a choice of vegatarian and vegan recipes in an easy to use format.
It features a welcome message on the **Homepage** to allow users to understand the purpose of the site as it is a very targeted recipe site.
The idea was to create an easy to use and interactive recipe site where the user can browse for various vegetarian and vegan options and also have the choice using **CRUD** functionality to create,read,update and delete their own recipes and provide extra functionality in the form of favouriting others recipes.
It also feature **search** functionality and **pagination** to aid the user when it gets to a point where there are alot of recipes, it rids the need to do endless scrolling as only a certain amount in this case 4 recipes will show per page but can easily be updated to display more.

#### Business Goals
  - To increase traffic to the site and in turn increase registration.
  - To provide simple easy sign up process to enable users to register.
  - To provide simple yet comprehensive information on recipes in the vegetarian/vegan area.
  - To be visually striking enough to catch attention and provoke curiosity to explore the page.
  - To potentially encourage advertisers to place their ads on the page for untensils and other cooking items thus opening up more opportunities for more recipes, engagement, special offers and expansion of the site.
  - To build awareness of the brand.
  - Get users to choose a recipe guide and to be able to engage by uploading their own thus making it a creative and user driven platform.

#### Customer Goals

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The site features a few choice colors being :
- ![#fbe5d0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fbe5d0/000000?text=+) **Paint-Chip** (#fbe5d0),
- ![#b1685d](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b1685d/000000?text=+) **Electric-Brown** (#b1685d),
- ![#519839](https://via.placeholder.com/15/519839/000000?text=+) **Green** similar to **Olive** (#519839),
- ![#b04632](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b04632/000000?text=+) **Medium Carmine** (#b04632),
- ![#e1eedd](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e1eedd/000000?text=+) **Off White** (#e1eedd),

These colours were chosen to give a **Spacious** feel to the website but not have it so empty that it was not a user friendly environment.
Also some of the colors were used to give a healthy earthy feel to the site through the mixture of green and brown mixed with creamy colours. The lack of images on the home page was used to direct the users attention to the text explaining the purpose of the site which is focused on functionality and not on display though the display aspect is addressed once the user navigates to the **recipes** page and onwards throught he use of cards with images displaying the recipes themselves.

## Fonts

- The site mainly uses the default font type of **"sans-serif"** for all pages to provide easy reading for all ages and so as to not overload the user with different font types which can make the information appear less clean and manageable. I considered adding a different font as I have in other projects to identify key information but as the site is fairly spacious I did not feel the need to highlight many areas as the information in my opinion is spaced out and laid out well enough to be readable as is.

## Imagery

The images used are all **recipe related**. I thought it was important to have a consistant theme of visually striking recipe images,
that were all close enough in subject matter and color to make a consistent feel across the site.The color of the images was important to have good contrast with the site **color scheme** since there is only a small amount of images present and 
I believe the images chosen fit very well overall as they relate to the subject matter of cooking but also provide good impact both visually in arrangement and colour wise with such a plain background through the rest of the site.

### Features Left to Implement

- **Terms and conditions** page to allow users to read through the legal documentation associated with the site.Too much time involved reviewing legal documentation to implement straight away.
- Option to change **languages** to some other than English.Too expensive to hire someone to check translations on current budget.
- Using **cloudinary** or similar for upload of images instead of image urls.Time constraints did not allow for implementation.
- **Filter** option so users have even more choice on how to view recipes on the main recipes page such as being able to choose- vegan + with butter + less than 15mins.Time constraints did not allow for implementation.
- More Details in recipes such as **allergen information** and **cost** to purchase ingredients.
- Country or cuisine style filters to allow users to search for a recipe based on its style such as **Italian**, **Indian** etc.Time constraints did not allow for implementation.

# [Testing](TESTING.md)

# Deployment 

- In order to deploy this project as I have the following is required [Python3](https://www.python.org/),  [Github account](https://github.com/),  [MongoDB account](https://www.mongodb.com/),  [Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com/).

After you have succesfully signed up for these and installed the requirements proceed as below.

#### Step 1 Clone the project 

To make a local clone, follow these steps. 
1. Log in to GitHub and go to the repository to wish to clone. 
2. Click on the green button that reads **Code**.
3. Click on **“Open with GitHub Desktop”** and follow the prompts.

#### Step 2 Use the local copy
1. Install all the requirements: Go to the workspace of your local copy. 
2. In the terminal type: **pip3 install -r requirements.txt** and hit enter, this will create
a file which python will need to run correctly as it contains a list of required dependancies.
3. Create your database in MongoDB using the following steps: 
    - **Login** to your account.
    - Create a **cluster** and a **database** within that cluster.
    - Create 3 collections in the database mine were named: **categories, recipes,** and **users.**
    - Add string values for the collections.(Mine were all string values with the exception of **favourite_recipes** in **users collection** which is an **array** for each user)
4. Create the environment variables 
    - Create a .gitignore file in the root directory of the project if it does not already contain one, this will be used to ignore and not share your environment variables.
    - Add the env.py file to the .gitignore file so its contents are ignored when pushing changes.
    - Create the file env.py. This  will contain all the environment variables such as os.environ.setdefault("IP", "Your IP here"), os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "Your port here"), os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "Your secret key here"), os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "Your mongo URI here"), os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "Your database name from mongDB here").
5. To run the application, open your terminal and type "python3 app.py" without quotes.

#### Step 3 Deploying to Heroku  
1. Set up local workspace for Heroku 
    - In your terminal type the following **pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt.** (This file is needed for Heroku to know which files to install as mentioned above a requirements.txt tells heroku you are working with python.)
2. In the terminal type the following **python app.py > Procfile** (The file is again for Heroku)
3. Login to your Heroku account and create a new app and select your region(I used **Europe**). 
4. Enable automatic deployment from GitHub by clicking on the deploy tab in Heroku and click **Connect to GitHub**. 
5. Search with your repository name from GitHub and when it finds it click to connect with it. 
6. Go to the application **settings** in Heroku and go to **Config Vars** this will contain your variable from earlier such as your secret key and your IP,Port etc
7. Click on **Reveal Config Vars**.
8. Enter the variables contained in your env.py file making sure that they match. **IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME must all be the same!**
9. Add and then commit the requirements.txt and Procfile to repository. 
10. Go back to the deploy tab in Heroku and navigate to **Automatic deployment**.
11. Click on **Enable Automatic Deployment** by using **Manual deployment**.
12. Finally Click on **Deploy Branch**.

To View the live app you can click on **Open app** in the right corner of your Heroku account. The app wil open and deployment is successful.
