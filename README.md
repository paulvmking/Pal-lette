It also feature **search** functionality and **pagination** to aid the user when it gets to a point where there are alot of recipes, it rids the need to do endless scrolling as only a certain amount in this case 4 recipes will show per page but can easily be updated to display more.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The site features a few choice colors being :
- ![#fbe5d0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fbe5d0/000000?text=+) **Paint-Chip** (#fbe5d0),
- ![#b1685d](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b1685d/000000?text=+) **Electric-Brown** (#b1685d),
- ![#519839](https://via.placeholder.com/15/519839/000000?text=+) **Green** similar to **Olive** (#519839),
- ![#b04632](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b04632/000000?text=+) **Medium Carmine** (#b04632),
- ![#e1eedd](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e1eedd/000000?text=+) **Off White** (#e1eedd),

These colours were chosen to give a **Spacious** feel to the website but not have it so empty that it was not a user friendly environment.
Also some of the colors were used to give a healthy earthy feel to the site through the mixture of green and brown mixed with creamy colours. The lack of images on the home page was used to direct the users attention to the text explaining the purpose of the site which is focused on functionality and not on display though the display aspect is addressed once the user navigates to the **recipes** page and onwards throught he use of cards with images displaying the recipes themselves.

## Fonts

- The site mainly uses the default font type of **"sans-serif"** for all pages to provide easy reading for all ages and so as to not overload the user with different font types which can make the information appear less clean and manageable. I considered adding a different font as I have in other projects to identify key information but as the site is fairly spacious I did not feel the need to highlight many areas as the information in my opinion is spaced out and laid out well enough to be readable as is.

## Imagery

The images used are all **recipe related**. I thought it was important to have a consistant theme of visually striking recipe images,
that were all close enough in subject matter and color to make a consistent feel across the site.The color of the images was important to have good contrast with the site **color scheme** since there is only a small amount of images present and 
I believe the images chosen fit very well overall as they relate to the subject matter of cooking but also provide good impact both visually in arrangement and colour wise with such a plain background through the rest of the site.
